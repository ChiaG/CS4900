We used the Gnu Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) due to its ready-made set of functions for dealing relatively precisely with floating-point numbers. 

You can learn about GMP and its functions here: https://gmplib.org/manual/

You can download GMP here: https://gmplib.org/#DOWNLOAD
... and find directions on how to install it here: https://gmplib.org/manual/Installing-GMP.html#Installing-GMP

Note that to use GMP you must link the -lgmp and -lm libraries. This is done in our makefiles by default.
