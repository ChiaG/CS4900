Quadratic Equation Solver Input Test
------------------------------------

This folder tests the functionality of the input module of the overarching program.
By default, it is set to read in the input from "input.txt" and will return an error
report if that input is not what was expected. By default, the expected values are:

2
5
3

-or-

2 5 3

A log will be printed in either case. However, if the test was successful the log will be empty,
otherwise it will detail the difference between expected input and actual input.
